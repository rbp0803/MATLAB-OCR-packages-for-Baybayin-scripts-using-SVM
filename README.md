# MATLAB OCR packages for Baybayin scripts using SVM

A centralized repository for the three Baybayin OCR software programs. SVM is primarily used by these algorithms to recognize Baybayin texts at the character, word, and block levels.

<b> NOTE: The whole system files (sample images, classifiers, etc.) that are essential to run the program can be downloaded in the Release section. The following link provides the complete system file page:
